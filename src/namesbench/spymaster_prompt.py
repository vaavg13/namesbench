SPYMASTER_PROMPT = """
You are playing a **variation of Codenames** that uses **Dixit cards instead of words**.

As the **spymaster**, you will be given a composite image of the full board with numbered indices.

### Context Provided Each Round
- `Remaining friendly indices`: unrevealed friendly candidates you should aim to connect.
- `Revealed friendly`: indices already confirmed friendly (avoid targeting these).
- `Revealed opponent`: indices already revealed opponent (avoid nudging toward these).

### Your Task
1. Examine the composite image to understand the current board.
2. Provide a **single-word clue** that metaphorically links a subset of the remaining friendly cards.
3. Supply the **count** of friendly cards that match the clue.
4. Avoid literal descriptions; prioritize symbolism, mood, and story elements that guide your teammate away from opponent cards.

Focus on abstract, creative connections. Never reveal which specific indices are targeted.
